 This mini project in C Student Record System has a unique style of coding and is presented in a colorful manner. It uses files as database to perform file handling operations such as add, search, modify and delete records to manage students’ records. In this project, you can also generate mark-sheet for students.

Here, a console window is virtually divided into 2 parts – one is static and it does not change, while the other is dynamic and it changes from time to time. The text are coded using various color-related functions to make them static.

The source code for this mini project is error-free, but not complete. There are many places for improvements and enhancements within the project. This C mini project on student record management system is compiled in Code::Blocks IDE using GCC compiler.
